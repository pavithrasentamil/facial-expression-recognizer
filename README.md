#FacialExpressionRecognizer
With developer Ashish I have learnt how to recognize facial expression by using keras within 2 hours where he told about generating new dataset by rotating and scaling,vaidating ,checkpointing and early stoping .I think this model will helpful in creating many projects related to CNN and thats why importing from him.
I couldn't upload my own because of system configirations.Tried with google colabaratory ..

Thank you ASHISH JI for making this quarantine useful with your content
